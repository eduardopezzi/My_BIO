# My_BIO >>>>>> EDUARDO PEZZI

I am a professional with over 15 years of experience in commercial operations management. During this time, Iâ€™ve honed my soft skills through experience on the retail side, and developed critical and analytical skills on the business management side. 

I am passionate about the startup space, and leveraged this by studying entrepreneurship at UC Berkeley and Blockchain Development at George Brown College. At the latter, I increased my proficiency in full-stack development and went on to earn the Citizenship Award for active engagement in the blockchain community. 

Moreover, I care deeply about technology and am an avid supporter of projects that use technology to leverage results that are industry-scale, design-driven, and have a community development impact, all the while driving business results.

Some of my portfolio projects:

* [Chekout Form - React](./Chekout_Form.pdf)
 
* [SignIT Project - React/Solidity/Cryptography/IPFS](./SignIT.pdf)

* [Voting System - React/MerkleTree/Solidity](./Voting_System(MerkleTree).pdf)
